🚧 Exploring Trends in U.S. Border Crossings with Data Visualization & Scenario Modeling 📊🗺️
I recently dove into a fascinating dataset on U.S. Border Crossings and used Python, Seaborn, and Plotly to explore key patterns over time. Here's what I uncovered:
📅 Trends Over Time: Visualized monthly and yearly fluctuations across various modes like personal vehicles, pedestrians, trucks, etc.
🇺🇸 Canada vs. Mexico: Compared border activity between the U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico borders — and yes, there are notable differences!
🚗 Busiest Ports & Seasonal Shifts: Identified the top 10 busiest ports and seasonal peaks in traffic volume.
📉 What if... Scenarios:
What if traffic increases by 20% next year?
What if personal vehicle traffic drops by 50%?
How would redistributing 10% of traffic from the top 5 to the next 10 ports impact volume?
🌎 Geographic Insights: Mapped the real-time traffic distribution using interactive maps to show volume hotspots.
📌 And yes — we looked at the impact of events like COVID-19 on cross-border movement.
💡 This project demonstrates how data storytelling and scenario modeling can be powerful tools in transportation planning, policy evaluation, and infrastructure optimization.
👉 If you're into data analytics, policy impact, or transport systems, I’d love to hear your thoughts!
